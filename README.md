This project demonstrates how to clean and preprocess a small employee dataset using pure Python, without relying on libraries like pandas or numpy
and no external libraries were used only built-in python functions and lists 

Tasks done include:
~Handling missing values using mean/median/mode
~Encoding categorical features (like Gender and Department)
~Normalizing numerical data using Min-Max scaling
~Detecting and removing outliers using IQR
